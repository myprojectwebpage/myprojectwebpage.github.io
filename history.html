            <p class="hobbies">This is a historical castle I made in history class. I was required to make a castle with a wall, keep, moat, drawbridge, and ground. I made an inner and an outer wall for double protection. I put the keep in the middle. A well next to the keep so they can get fresh water every day. The drawbridge is in front of the castle for easy access.
